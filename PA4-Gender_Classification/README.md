Classifying gender based on face images

To run SVM:
- Run 'make' in libsvm folder
- Run 'bash PA4-svm-train.sh' in main directory
- Run 'bash PA4-svm-test.sh' in main directory
- Run 'head -1 *.output > results.txt' in main directory

results.txt will hold the accuracy percentage for each variation of the SVM classifier we tested.



To run Bayes Classifier:
- Run 'make GC.exe' in this folder
- Run './GC.exe' in this folder
